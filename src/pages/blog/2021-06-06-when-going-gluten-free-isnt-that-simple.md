## My first attempt at avoiding gluten failed

I often think about how far I’ve come since first trying to go gluten free. I was actually told by a doctor in 2016 that I should try going gluten free. In 2016, I did not feel well. I felt afraid that something was wrong, but I had no idea yet that I would be diagnosed with Hashimoto’s. 

The doctor who recommended I try going gluten free did not run any tests and I did not feel that he took me very seriously. Still, I decided I’d give it a try. Immediately, I eliminated obvious sources of gluten from my diet.

At the time, I lived with two roommates who were not gluten free. They respected my new gluten-free lifestyle, but we still had a lot of gluten in the house. 

After several months of going gluten-free, I was officially diagnosed with a gluten allergy by my naturopathic doctor who told me that my antibodies indicated that I was still eating gluten. 

## What I had to do to actually get rid of gluten

I felt discouraged and confused. I had been avoiding gluten for so long what else was I supposed to do? At that time, I did some research and learned more about gluten cross-contamination. I had no idea that even tiny amounts of gluten on sponges, towels, and pans was something I needed to watch out for. As I entered a panicked state, not knowing how to even begin avoiding all of the gluten in our house, one of my roommates said that we could go to the store, and get me some of my own pots and pans to use. 

We drove Bed, Bath & Beyond and went on a little shopping spree. I was so fortunate to have such a supportive friend that helped me to figure out the next step. Finding out that you have to avoid not just gluten containing foods, but also gluten containing sponges and pans can be extremely overwhelming. 

From that point forward, I kept my own dishes, pots and pans in my own cabinet. It was a lot of work, and when people came over it was really awkward telling them they couldn’t use my gluten free cabinet of pans. However, doing this helped me to finally eliminate gluten from my diet. 

Before I went gluten free, I had no idea how challenging it was. I would see oatmeal labeled as gluten free and think ‘why are they saying it’s gluten free when oats don’t have any gluten’. Little did I know that oats can be processed around gluten, making it important to buy gluten-free oats if you have a gluten allergy. 

## My main takeaways from this experience:

1. Having an experience like this makes you realized just how supportive your friends might be in your time of need
2. Going gluten free means a lot more than just not eating gluten containing foods
3. Doing what you need to to keep gluten out of your diet can be awkward and make you self conscious. But with that said, it’s important to look after your own health and not worry about any judgements

We should all feel empowered to take the steps that we need to so that our bodies can heal. Taking these steps can often be a LOT of work. For me, all of this work was worth it.
