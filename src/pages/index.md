  title: About Michelle
  description: >
    I love fitness, running, eating nourishing foods, and exploring the outdoors
    with my fiancé Ben and our English Bulldog Brutus. I was diagnosed with
    Hashimoto's in 2017 and have since then been working toward restoring my
    health. 
description: I created this blog because my experiences with Hashimoto's have
  made me passionate about food, self care, and overall wellness. Here are four
  driving ideas behind this blog.

      text: "Data Project: There are so many opinions and ideas about the best way to
        heal from autoimmune disease. While many of the protocols that I find
        online have much in common, none of them are exactly the same. Nobody
        really has all the answers. Part of this is likely because everyone’s
        body and health journey is so different. To elevate my health journey to
        the next level, and to adopt a more personalized approach for myself, I
        have decided to take a data-driven approach. In this blog, I plan to
        track my health over time, using data that I collect about how I feel
        and what I eat, and I will analyze it to find insights. I’m hoping that
        this effort will uncover information about myself that I would not find
        otherwise. I’m excited to share my journey with everyone here!"

      text: "Community: I created this blog not only to share about myself, but also
        to find a community of others with similar experiences. I find that so
        much of the information on the internet is telling us ‘this is the way
        to heal’. While I have made tremendous progress by changing my diet and
        lifestyle, I am still working to learn more about how I can restore my
        health and lower my antibodies. I imagine there are many other people
        out there in similar shoes as mine: desperate to move forward in their
        health journey and confused why certain diets haven’t lowered their
        antibodies as much as they had hoped. I am not intending to tell people
        how to heal in this blog. Instead, I am hoping to create a connection
        with others, and share experiences. I will share things in this blog
        that I have found from my own experiences, and I would love to talk to
        anyone reading this about their experiences as well. I think that by
        coming together, we can all learn from each other, find a community of
        support, and see that we are not alone in the obstacles that we are
        facing in our healing journeys. "

      text: "Fitness: Having been a former track and cross country runner, I want to
        share my perspectives on fitness as it overlaps with healing. I have
        gone back and forth over and over again about what fitness plan is best
        for my body. Is it healthy for me to run every single day? Regular
        running may not necessarily be the ‘gentle exercise’ often recommended
        for healing. But what about the challenging emotional struggle of moving
        away from doing something I love, even fearing it, and questioning if
        it’s good for me. Lately, I have been exploring forms of exercise such
        as yoga, pilates, and ballet. I’d like to get more into these and focus
        on developing muscle strength in addition to the cardio that I’ve always
        included as part of my workout regimen. "

      text: "Nourishing Food on a Busy Schedule: Taking the time to heal while working
        and keeping up with the other demands of our everyday lives can be
        extremely challenging. I've learned a lot of tips for keeping my body
        well fed over the past several years and plan to share them here. "

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
