### Let's start from the beginning

I grew up in Colorado Springs and was very active and healthy. I ran track and cross country in high school, and loved running. I loved the way it made me feel and I loved the community of friends that having a team brought me. 

Up until this point, I really didn't have any obvious health problems. 

Beginning my senior year of high school and throughout college, I began to struggle with digestive issues. Little did I know this was only the beginning of a long health journey that I am still on. 

In college, I continued to run daily, and I excelled in school. I was determined to succeed at everything I set my mind to, but the stress and long hours studying really took a toll on my body. 

Soon after graduation, I knew that something wasn’t right as I started to experience various strange symptoms (dry eyes and blepharitis, acne, irregular hormones, and hives just to name a few). I visited several doctors, but none of them really knew what was going on. One suggested that I keep a stress journal and avoid gluten.

### Diagnosed with Hashimoto's

In the winter of 2017, I finally decided to see a naturopathic doctor. This was the doctor who ran my bloodwork and revealed that I had Hashimoto’s. 

I was devastated. I had no idea what this meant for my life. After spending most of my life without any health issues or allergies at all, I had a really hard time accepting this. I couldn’t even tell people that I was going through this without breaking into tears. 

My mom (who lived across the country from me) suggested that I try an elimination diet, which she had read about on the internet. This is when I began following the autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet. 

I also worked with my naturopathic doctor to identify other issues (like gut infections) that were present. 

### The present

Since that time, I have dramatically improved or eliminated most of my symptoms. However, I still feel like I haven’t completely identified the root of my issues. This is a large part of why I created this blog - I wanted to not only share about my own experiences but also engage with a community of people who are going through the same things that I am. I constantly question if I am making the right decisions for my body, I  experience a lot of fear around introducing new foods, and I question why my thyroid hasn’t healed as much as I had hoped. 

Currently, I still work with a naturopathic doctor. However, to better understand my body and health I have decided to begin a process of collecting more data about myself (foods I eat, stress levels, weight, blookwork, sleep, etc.) and taking a more analytical look. I am hoping to uncover trends that I might not have observed otherwise. I am really excited about this project and excited to share it with everyone here. There is so much power in data to discover things that we might not be able to predict or understand. 

I have previously focused mostly on my diet, but I am working on taking an approach that focuses more on my overall well-being. Stress is a big issue for me, for example, and that's something I'm trying to work on now.
